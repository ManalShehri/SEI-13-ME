# Learning Python

You've learned JavaScript. Getting started with a totally new language doesn't have to be hard. The biggest key is to practice doing something that you *already know* in the context of the new language. This is called a *transfer task*. The more languages and computer science concepts you learn, the easier new ones become to pick up and its mostly syntax, quirks and language-specific tools that become the tricky part.

Now, your task is to *teach yourself* a bit of Python. The goal here isn't to become a Python master, but to explore and learn a bit about a new language.

**All exercises below should be done with Python 3**

## Goals:

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

- Create a simple python program
- Execute a simple python program
- Articulate basic differences between Python and other languages you know
- Feel comfortable understanding what is generally happening in most basic python programs


## Research: What is Python

Your first task is to research Python to be able to understand some of its basic concepts. Edit this `README.md` file to answer the below questions:

##### What paradigms does Python support?

- imperative
- functional
- procedural
- object-oriented

##### What typing discipline does it follow?

Python is dynamic typed and strong typed

##### Is it a high or low level language?

high level language

##### Does it have built in memory management and garbage collection?

yes

##### What languages was Python influenced by?

C

##### Is it a compiled or interpeted language?

interpreted language

##### Does it have strong support for functional programming?

Yes



## Hello World

Write a program in `hello_world/hello_world.py` that prints 'Hello, World!' to the standard output (terminal).

## Fizzbuzz

Write a program in `fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz.py` that does the following:

For numbers 1 through 100, print `fizz` if the number is divisible by 3, `buzz` if the number is divisible by 5 and `fizzbuzz` if the number if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5. If the number isn't divisible by 3 or 5, just output the number itself.

The output should look something like `1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 Fizz Buzz 16 17 Fizz...`

## Fibonacci

Write a program in `fibonacci/fib.py` that will output the N-th term of the [Fibonacci sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

For example: `print fib(6)` should output `8`.

## Project Euler Problem 1

Project Euler's first problem is:

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Write the code to complete this in `euler_1/sum_of_natural_numbers.py`

## Conclusion

How does Python compare to other langauges you've used?
