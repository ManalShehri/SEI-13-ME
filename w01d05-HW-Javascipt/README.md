# Javascript Homework

1.  Variables

2.  Conditions

## Assignment Operator
Without running the following code, try to determine:

```js
let a = 1;
let b = 'bongos';
let c = true;

a = b;
b = c;
c = a;
```

### Your solution here:
1.  What is `a`?
```
a is ... bongos
```
2.  What is `b`?
```
b is ... true
```
3.  What is `c`?
```
c is ... bongos
```

## Concatenation
Use the `+` operator to concatenate these strings together within a `console.log()`: "Please", "squeeze", "the", "cheese". Make sure there are spaces in-between each word.

```js
const firstWord = "Please";
const secondWord = "squeeze";
const thirdWord = "the";
const fourthWord = "cheese";
```
Result should be:
```js
"Please squeeze the cheese"
```

### Your solution here:
4.  Fill in the `console.log()`?
```js
console.log(firstWord+' '+secondWord+' '+thirdWord+' '+fourthWord)
```

Output a console log `The sum of 5 and 10 is 15` where the values for 5 and 10 are saved to variables, and where 15 comes from those variables being summed.
```js
const num1 = 5;
const num2 = 10;
```

### Your solution here:
5.  How can we make `num3` equal to the sum of `num1` and `num2`?
```js
// your solution here
let num3 = num1+num2;
```
6.  Use variables `num1`, `num2` and `num3` to fill in the `console.log()` to complete the sentence: 

>The sum of 5 and 10 is 15

```js
console.log("The sum of "+num1+" and "+ num2+" is "+num3)
```

## Comparisons
By just looking at the following expressions, determine in your mind whether or not each will evaluate to true or false
```
a) 999 > 999
b) 999 === 999 
c) 999 !== 999
d) -5 >= -4
e) 100 <= -100
f) 20 + 5 < 5 
g) 81 / 9 === 9
h) 9 !== 8 + 1
```
### Your solution here:
7.  Write `true` or `false` based on the list above
```
a) false
b) true
c) false
d) false
e) false
f) false
g) true
h) false
```

## Conditionals
Declare a variable equal to a number 0 to 100

Write a conditional statement that...
- If it is a multiple of 3, print “Fizz” instead of the number.
- If it is a multiple of 5, print “Buzz” instead of the number.
- If it is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.
- Otherwise, print the number

### Your solution here:
8.  Write your javascript solution below
```js
// your answer here
var num = 3;
if (num>=0 && num <=100) {
  if (num != 0 && num % 3 == 0 && num % 5 == 0) {
    console.log('FizzBuzz');
  }
  else if (num != 0 && num % 3 == 0) {
    console.log('Fizz');
  }
  else if (num != 0 && num % 5 == 0) {
    console.log('Buzz');
  }
  else {
    console.log(num);
  }
} else {
    console.log('The number either greater than 100 or less than 0');
}
```



## Array Practice

Using 

### What's in Your Closet?

Below, we've given you examples of Kristyn and Thom's closets modeled as data in JavaScript.

```javascript
const kristynsCloset = [
	'left shoe',
	'cowboy boots',
	'right sock',
	'GA hoodie',
	'green pants',
	'yellow knit hat',
	'marshmallow peeps',
];

// Thom's closet is more complicated. Check out this nested data structure!!
const thomsCloset = [
	[
		// These are Thom's shirts
		'grey button-up',
		'dark grey button-up',
		'light blue button-up',
		'blue button-up',
	],
	[
		// These are Thom's pants
		'grey jeans',
		'jeans',
		'PJs',
	],
	[
		// Thom's accessories
		'wool mittens',
		'wool scarf',
		'raybans',
	],
];
```

1. What's Kristyn wearing today? Using bracket notation to access items in `kristynsCloset`, log the sentence "Kristyn is rocking that " + _the third item in Kristyn's closet_ + " today!" to the console.

1. Kristyn can't find her left shoe. Remove this item from her closet and save it to a variable named `kristynShoe`.

1. Kristyn just bought some sweet shades! Add `"raybans"` to her closet **after `"yellow knit hat"`.**

1. Kristyn spilled coffee on her hat... modify this item to read `"stained knit hat"` instead of yellow.

1. Put together an outfit for Thom! Using **bracket notation**, access the first element in Thom's `shirts` array.

1. In the same way, access one item from Thom's pants array.

1. Access one item from Thom's accessories array.

1. Log a sentence about what Thom's wearing. Example: `"Thom is looking fierce in a grey button-up, jeans and wool scarf!"`

1. Get more specific about what kind of PJs Thom's wearing this winter. Modify the name of his PJ pants to `Footie Pajamas`.
 
### After finishing all the steps place your solution here:

Write your javascript solution below
```js
// your answer here


////////////////////// Kristyn //////////////////////

// Using bracket notation to access items in kristynsCloset, log the sentence "Kristyn is rocking that " + the third item in Kristyn's closet + " today!" to the console.
console.log("Kristyn is rocking that " + kristynsCloset[2] + " today!" );

// Remove this item from her closet and save it to a variable named kristynShoe.
var kristynShoe = kristynsCloset.shift();

// Add "raybans" to her closet after "yellow knit hat".
kristynsCloset.splice(5, 0, "raybans");

// modify this item to read "stained knit hat" instead of yellow.
kristynsCloset[4] = 'stained knit hat';


////////////////////// Thom //////////////////////
 
// Using bracket notation, access the first element in Thom's shirts array.
var ThomsShirt = thomsCloset[0][0];

// access one item from Thom's pants array.
var ThomPants = thomsCloset[1][0];

// Access one item from Thom's accessories array.
var ThomAccessoried = thomsCloset[2][0];

// Log a sentence about what Thom's wearing. 
console.log('Thom is looking fierce in '+ThomsShirt+','+ThomPants+' and '+ThomAccessoried+'!');

// Modify the name of his PJ pants to Footie Pajamas.
thomsCloset[1][2] = 'Footie Pajamas';

```
