## MVC - Lesson Objectives

1. Define MVC and explain why it matters
1. Move our data into a separate file
1. Move our presentation code into an EJS file

<br>

## Define MVC and explain why it matters

- One of the core tenants of good programming is to compartmentalize your code
- Already our code is getting a little messy
    - we have data, app instantiation (listening), and routes all in one file
- One way to keep an app from getting messy is to separate it out into three sections
    - Models
        - data (javascript variables)
    - Views
        - how the data is displayed to the user (HTML)
    - Controllers
        - the glue that connects the models with the views
- This allows various developers to divide up a large code base
    - minimizes likelihood of developers overwriting each others code
    - allows developers to specialize
        - one can focus just on getting good with dealing with data
        - one can focus just on getting good with html
        - one can focus just on getting good with connecting the two
- Think of MVC as a restaurant
    - Models are the cook
        - prepares food/data
    - Views are the customer
        - consumes food/data
    - Controllers are the waiter
        - brings food from cook to customer
        - has no idea how food/data is prepared
        - has no idea how the food/data is consumed

<br>

## Move our data into a separate file

1. Create a directory called models inside our app directory
1. Inside /models, create your data file (fruits.js)
1. Put your fruits variable in there

    ```javascript
    const fruits = [
        {
            name:'apple',
            color: 'red',
            readyToEat: true
        },
        {
            name:'pear',
            color: 'green',
            readyToEat: false
        },
        {
            name:'banana',
            color: 'yellow',
            readyToEat: true
        }
    ];    
    ```

1. We now require that file in the original server.js

    ```javascript
    const fruits = require('./models/fruits.js'); //NOTE: it must start with ./ if it's just a file, not an NPM package
    ```

1. But, we could have multiple variables in our /models/fruits.js file.
    - How does javascript know which variable in /models/fruits.js to assign to the fruits const in server.js (the result of the `require()` statment)?
    - We must tell javascript which variable we want to be the result of the `require()` statement in server.js

        ```javascript
        //at the bottom of /models/fruits.js
        module.exports = fruits;
        ```
<br>

## Move our presentation code into an EJS file

Now we want to move our View code (HTML) into a separate file just like we did with the data

- [EJS](https://ejs.co/)
- [EJS + Express](https://github.com/mde/ejs/wiki/Using-EJS-with-Express)

1. Install the NPM package EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
    - this is a templating library that allows us to mix data into our html
    - the HTML will change based on the data!
    - `npm i ejs`
1. Require ejs

	```js
	const ejs = require('ejs');
		
		...	
	
	app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
	```

1. `mkdir views` directory inside our app directory
1. Inside `/views`, create a file called `show.ejs`
    - this will be the html for our show route
1. Put some html into `show.ejs`

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	  <head>
	    <meta charset="utf-8">
	    <title></title>
	  </head>
	  <body>
	    <h1>Fruits show page</h1>
	  </body>
	</html>     
    ```

1. Now, instead of `res.send('some text')`, we can call `res.render('show.ejs')`
    - express will know to look inside the /views directory
    - it will send the html in the show.ejs file as a response

        ```javascript
        app.get('/fruits/:indexOfFruitsArray', function(req, res){
            res.render('show');
        });        
        ```

Now lets mix our data into our HTML

1. Our route is acting like the controller now.  Let's gather the data and pass it to the view

    ```javascript
    app.get('/fruits/:indexOfFruitsArray', function(req, res){
        res.render('show.ejs', { //second param must be an object
            fruit: fruits[req.params.indexOfFruitsArray] //there will be a variable available inside the ejs file called fruit, its value is fruits[req.params.indexOfFruitsArray]
        });
    });    
    ```

1. Access the data in the view:

    ```html
 	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	  <head>
	    <meta charset="utf-8">
	    <title></title>
	  </head>
	  <body>
	    <h1>Fruits show page</h1>
	    The <%=fruit.name; %> is  <%=fruit.color; %>.
	    <% if(fruit.readyToEat === true){ %>
	      It is ready to eat
	    <% } else { %>
	      It is not ready to eat
	    <% } %>
	  </body>
	</html> 
    ```

1. Note that there are two types of new tags
    - `<% %>` run some javascript
    - `<%= %>` run some javascript and insert the result of the javascript into the HTML
    
<br>
    
## Update Index Route:

Update the index route in server.js:

```javascript
app.get('/fruits/', (req, res) => {
  res.render(
    'index',
    {
      allFruits:fruits
    }
  );
});
```

Create an `index.ejs` file:

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Fruits index page</h1>
    <ul>
      <% for(let i = 0; i < allFruits.length; i++) { %>
        <li>
          <a href="/fruits/<%=i%>"><%=allFruits[i].name %></a>
        </li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

Add a link back to the index route in show.ejs:

```html
<a href="/fruits">Back to Index</a>
```

<br>

## Middleware

We know how to create functionality for each route. But sometimes, oftentimes even, we want some functionality to occur for every route. We can do this by adding `middleware`


```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('I run for all routes');
    next();
});
```

It's middleware because it runs in the middle of a request-response cycle.

**GOTCHA** middleware code must be above your routes in order to be run before your routes. Once your route runs the middleware is unreachable/unused.

Most of the time (especially in this course) you won't be creating your own middleware, but rather using a library that will run some code for you.



### Body Parser

Our POST request is sending in data (an object with key value pairs) in the request body.

However, the HTTP protocol just sends ( url encoded) strings. Our express app has no idea what to do with this string.

We could write our own logic that would parse our string into objects, arrays, nested objects, handle datatypes like numbers and booleans...so we'd have a useable data source coming in our POST request.  and then write that logic for every single express app.

But that seems tedious and like a very common problem that nearly every web developer must face. Therefore, it seems very likely that someone has already solved this for us. And indeed, express has a build in function we can use.

There is a bit of a history with body-parser. Express strives to be a minimalist framework. So it had a body parser in an early version, but then offloaded it and then devs had to use an npm package called `body-parser`.  Then the powers that build and maintain express brought it back. Currently it is a built in function

[From the docs](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#express.urlencoded)

```javascript
//near the top, around other app.use() calls
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:false}));
```

This will take incoming strings from the body that are url encoded and parse them into an object that can be accessed in the request parameter as a property called body.  

`extended: false` - has to do with how the data is being parsed (and what kind can be parsed). For this unit, we'll just set this to false.


We can now return to our `post route`

```javascript
app.post('/fruits', (req, res)=>{
    console.log('Create route accessed!');
    console.log('Req.body is: ', req.body);
    res.send(req.body);
});
```

and try again

```javascript
curl -X POST -d name="dragon fruit" -d color="pink" -d localhost:3000/fruits
```

We should now get back our updated array.

<br>

## Working with Data

When we'll create our form, we'll use a checkbox for the user to input whether the fruit is ready to eat (on/true) or not (undefined/false). Check boxes have values of `on` or `off`.

We want our property of `readyToEat` to be a Boolean - either `true` or false. Let's write some logic to udpate this.    

```javascript
app.post('/fruits', (req, res)=>{
    if(req.body.readyToEat === 'on'){ // if checked, req.body.readyToEat is set to 'on'
      req.body.readyToEat = true
    } else { // if not checked, req.body.readyToEat is undefined
      req.body.readyToEat = false
    }
    fruits.push(req.body)
    res.send(req.body)
})
```

<br>

# New

## Lesson Objectives

1. Create a new route and page
1. Add interactivity to your site with forms
1. Redirect the user to another page


Next, we want to be able to create a new fruit. Let's review our 7 restful routes:


|#|Action|URL|HTTP Verb|EJS view filename|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1| Index | /fruits/ | GET | index.ejs |
|2| Show | /fruits/:index | GET | show.ejs |
|3| **New** | **/fruits/new**| **GET** | **new.ejs** |
|4| Create | /fruits/ | POST| none |
|5| Edit ||||
|6| Update ||||
|7| Destroy |||||

## Create a new route and page

1. Let's create a page that will allow us to create a new fruit using a form
1. First, we'll need a route for displaying the page in our server.js file **IMPORTANT: put this above your show route, so that the show route doesn't accidentally pick up a /fruits/new request**

    ```javascript
    //put this above your show.ejs file
    app.get('/fruits/new', (req, res) => {
        res.render('new.ejs');
    });
    ```

1. Now lets's create the html for this page in our /views/new.ejs file

	- `touch views/new.ejs`

	```html
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
	  <head>
	    <meta charset="utf-8">
	    <title>New Form</title>
	  </head>
	  <body>
	
	  </body>
	</html>
	```


1. Visit http://localhost:3000/fruits/new to see if it works

<br>

## Add interactivity to your site with forms

We can use forms to allow the user to enter their own data:


Breaking down the parts of a form

- `<form>` - this encompasses all the elements in a form
  - `action` where should this form be sent (for us it will be the relative path `/fruits`)
  - `method` - this will be a `POST` route, which is in line for our 7 RESTful routes pattern for creating a new fruit
- `<label>` - this is for visual formatting and web accessibility
  - `for` attribute that should match `id` in the companion `input` - again for web accessibility
- `<input />` - a self closing tag
  - `type` we'll use `text`, `checkbox` and `submit` for this project but there are many more like, `number`, `password`... you can always google for a more exhaustive list
  - `name` - this field **MUST** match your key value for your incoming data. This gets parsed as the key with `body-parser`


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>New Fruit Page</h1>
    <form action="/fruits" method="POST">
      <label for="name">Name</label>
      <input type="text" name="name" id="name"/>
      <label for="color">Color</label>
      <input type="text" name="color" id="color" />
      <label for="isReadyToEat">Is Ready to Eat</label>
      <input type="checkbox" name="readyToEat" id="isReadyToEat" />
      <input type="submit" value="Create Fruit">
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Polishing

Right now, on successful POST, our data is just rendered as JSON. We should redirect it back to our index page or (bonus figure this out!) to the new show page of our new fruit.

```js
// create
app.post('/fruits', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body)
  if (req.body.readyToEat === 'on') { // if checked, req.body.readyToEat is set to 'on'
    req.body.readyToEat = true
  } else { // if not checked, req.body.readyToEat is undefined
    req.body.readyToEat = false
  }
  fruits.push(req.body)
  res.redirect('/fruits')
})

```



Put a link in the index page going to the new page

```html
<nav>
    <a href="/fruits/new">Create a New Fruit</a>
</nav>
```

# Static Files

## Lesson Objectives

1. Create a static files folder for CSS/JS

## Create a static files folder for CSS/JS

- CSS/JS code doesn't change with server-side data
- We can toss any static files into a 'public' directory
    - static means unchanging
    - dynamic means changing depending on data

Let's set up a directory for our static code:

1. Create a directory called `public`
1. Inside the `public` directory create a directory called `css`
1. Inside the `css` directory, create an `app.css` file
1. Put some CSS in the `app.css` file
1. Inside server.js place the following near the top:

    ```javascript
    app.use(express.static('public')); //tells express to try to match requests with files in the directory called 'public'
    ```

1. In your html, you can now call that css file

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/app.css">    
    ```

Let's try some CSS

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Comfortaa|Righteous');

body {
  background: url(https://images.clipartlogo.com/files/istock/previews/8741/87414357-apple-seamless-pastel-colors-pattern-fruits-texture-background.jpg);
  margin: 0;
  font-family: 'Comfortaa', cursive;
}

h1 {
  font-family: 'Righteous', cursive;
  background: antiquewhite;
  margin:0;
  margin-bottom: .5em;
  padding: 1em;
  text-align: center;
}

a {
  color: orange;
  text-decoration: none;
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px black;
  font-size: 1.5em;
  background: rgba(193, 235, 187, .9);
  /* padding: .25em;
  margin: .5em; */

}

a:hover {
  color: ghostwhite;
}

li {
  list-style: none;
}

li a {
  color: mediumseagreen;
}

input[type=text] {
  padding: .3em;
}

input[type=submit] {
  padding: .3em;
  color: orange;
  background: mediumseagreen;
  font-size: 1em;
  border-radius: 10%;
}

```

# Express - Delete

## Lesson Objectives

1. Create a Delete Route
1. Make the index page send a DELETE request


## Delete


|#|Action|URL|HTTP Verb|EJS view filename|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1| Index | /fruits/ | GET | index.ejs |
|2| Show | /fruits/:index | GET | show.ejs |
|3| New | /fruits/new| GET | new.ejs |
|4| Create | /fruits/ | POST| none |
|5| Edit ||||
|6| Update ||||
|7| **Destroy** |**/fruits/:index**|**DELETE**|**none**||



### Create a Delete Route

Inside our server.js file, add a DELETE route:

```javascript
app.delete('/fruits/:index', (req, res) => {
	fruits.splice(req.params.index, 1); //remove the item from the array
	res.redirect('/fruits');  //redirect back to index route
});
```

Test it using:

```
curl -X DELETE localhost:3000/fruits/1
```

See our `index.ejs` has only two list item fruits, apple, banana
```
curl localhost:3000/fruits/
```

### Make the index page send a DELETE request

Inside our `index.ejs` file, add a form with just a delete button.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Index of Fruits</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Index of Fruits</h1>
    <nav>
      <a href="/fruits/new">Create a New Fruit</a>
    </nav>
    <ul>
    <% fruits.forEach((fruit, index) => { %>
      <li>
		<a href="/fruits/<%=index%>"> <%= fruit.name %></a>
		<!--  ADD DELETE FORM HERE-->
		<form>
			<input type="submit" value="DELETE"/>
		</form>
	  </li>
    <% }) %>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

When we click "DELETE" on our index page (`index.ejs`), the form needs to make a DELETE request to our DELETE route.

The problem is that forms can't make DELETE requests.  Only POST and GET.  We can fake this, though.  First we need to install an npm package called `method-override`

```
npm install method-override
```

Now, in our server.js file, add:

```javascript
//include the method-override package
const methodOverride = require('method-override');
//...
//after app has been defined
//use methodOverride.  We'll be adding a query parameter to our delete form named _method
app.use(methodOverride('_method'));
```

Now go back and set up our delete form to send a DELETE request to the appropriate route

```html
<form action="/fruits/<%= index %>?_method=DELETE" method="POST">
```

# Express - Update

## Lesson Objectives


1. Create an edit route
1. Create a link to the edit route
1. Create an update route
1. Make the edit page send a PUT request

## Edit


|#|Action|URL|HTTP Verb|EJS view filename|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1| Index | /fruits/ | GET | index.ejs |
|2| Show | /fruits/:index | GET | show.ejs |
|3| New | /fruits/new| GET | new.ejs |
|4| Create | /fruits/ | POST| none |
|5| **Edit** |**/fruits/:id**|**GET**|**edit.ejs**|
|6| **Update** |**/fruits**|**PUT**|**none**|
|7| Destroy | /fruits/:index | DELETE |none |



## Update

### Create an update route

In order to UPDATE, we use the http verb PUT.

Inside server.js add the following:

```javascript
app.put('/fruits/:index', (req, res) => { // :index is the index of our fruits array that we want to change
	if(req.body.readyToEat === 'on'){ //if checked, req.body.readyToEat is set to 'on'
		req.body.readyToEat = true
	} else { //if not checked, req.body.readyToEat is undefined
		req.body.readyToEat = false
	}
	fruits[req.params.index] = req.body //in our fruits array, find the index that is specified in the url (:index).  Set that element to the value of req.body (the input data)
	res.redirect('/fruits'); //redirect to the index page
})
```

Test with cURL

```
curl -X PUT -d name="tomato" -d color="red" localhost:3000/2
```

```
curl localhost:3000/fruits
```

Our last fruit (banana) should now be a tomato


### Create an edit route

In our `server.js`, create a GET route which will just display an edit form for a single fruit

```javascript
app.get('/fruits/:index/edit', (req, res)=>{
	res.render(
		'edit.ejs', //render views/edit.ejs
		{ //pass in an object that contains
			fruit: fruits[req.params.index], //the fruit object
			index: req.params.index //... and its index in the array
		}
	)
})
```

Now let's grab our create form  and update it for editing in `views/edit.ejs`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
	    <meta charset="utf-8">
	    <title></title>
	</head>
	<body>
	  <h1>Edit Fruit Page</h1>
	  <form action="/fruits" method="POST">
	    <label for="name">Name</label>
	    <input type="text" name="name" id="name"/>
	    <label for="color">Color</label>
	    <input type="text" name="color" id="color" />
	    <label for="isReadyToEat">Is Ready to Eat</label>
	    <input type="checkbox" name="readyToEat" id="isReadyToEat" />
	    <input type="submit" value="Edit Fruit">
	  </form>
	</body>
</html>
```

### Create a link to the edit route

Inside our `index.ejs` file, add a link to our edit route which passes in the index of that item in the url

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Index of Fruits</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Index of Fruits</h1>
    <nav>
      <a href="/fruits/new">Create a New Fruit</a>
    </nav>
    <ul>
    <% fruits.forEach((fruit, index) => { %>
      <li>
        <a href="/fruits/<%=index%>"> <%= fruit.name %></a>
        <form action="/fruits/<%= index %>?_method=DELETE" method="POST">
          <input type="submit" value="DELETE"/>
        </form>
        <a href="/fruits/<%=index %>/edit">Edit</a>
      </li>
    <% }) %>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Make the edit page send a PUT request

When we click "Submit Changes" on our edit page (edit.ejs), the form needs to make a PUT request to our update route

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Edit a Fruit</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Edit Fruit Page</h1>
      <form action="/fruits/<%=index%>?_method=PUT" method="POST">
        <label for="name">Name</label>
        <input type="text" name="name" id="name"/>
        <label for="color">Color</label>
        <input type="text" name="color" id="color" />
        <label for="isReadyToEat">Is Ready to Eat</label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="readyToEat" id="isReadyToEat" />
        <input type="submit" value="Edit Fruit">
      </form>
    </body>
</html>
```

What is frustrating, is that our users have to remember which fruit they clicked on and update/reenter all the values.

We should at least set values in the form for the user to update

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Edit a Fruit</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Edit Fruit Page</h1>
      <form action="/fruits/<%=index%>?_method=PUT" method="POST">
        <label for="name">Name</label>
        <input type="text" name="name" id="name" value="<%=fruit.name%>"/>
        <label for="color">Color</label>
        <input type="text" name="color" id="color" value="<%=fruit.color%>"/>
        <label for="isReadyToEat">Is Ready to Eat</label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="readyToEat" id="isReadyToEat"
        <% if(fruit.readyToEat === true){ %>
  				checked
  			<% } %>
        />
        <input type="submit" value="Edit Fruit">
      </form>
    </body>
</html>
```
