# Week 4 Day 1 - Homework 
## Using Iterators

Inside this folder are six JavaScript files with different problems - two each for  `forEach`, and `filter`, and one for `reduce` and `map` 
and two more as bonus `map-bonus` and `bonus` that require a mix of iterators to solve 

Follow the instructions in each file and use iterators to solve each problem.
