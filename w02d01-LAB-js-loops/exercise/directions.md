# Exercises: JavaScript loops

## Print every number from 0 to 10

## Print every number from 4 to -16

## Print every fifth number from 8 to 41

## The classic Fizzbuzz Program

For every `number` between 1 and 100...

If the `number` is evenly divisible by 3, print "Fizz"

If the `number` is evenly divisible by 5, print "Buzz"

If the `number` is evenly divisible by 3 AND evenly divisible by 5, print "Fizzbuzz"

## The even/odd reporter

Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").

## Multiplication Tables

Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").

Bonus: Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).

## The Grade Assigner

Create a new array var of different grades from (60 - 100) - so your log should show "For 89, you got a B. For 90, you got an A.", etc. using that array of grades.
