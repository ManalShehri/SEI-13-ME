1. Mia, Albert, and Tony are going to a party. Set "attendees" to an array of their names.

	```js
	attendees = [null];
	```


1. Create the same array in a different way -- 
      by creating a new Array object.

	```js
	attendees = null;
	```

1. Access the third element in the array. 

	```js
	attendees
	```

1. Write a statement which sorts the array.

	```js
	attendees
	```

1. Write a statement which removes the last 
     element of the array. 

	```js
	attendees
	```


1. Write a statement which shifts a new element
     into the array as element 0 -- "Elaine"
	
	```js
	attendees
	```


1. `console.log` the following poem. Do it using 
	a single console.log statement! Make sure there
	are four separate lines in the console output. 

	Computers are fun,
	Because they are neat.
	Javascript and Ruby,
	They cannot be beat! */

	```js
	console.log(null);
	```



## WHILE LOOPS


1. Fix the below while loop so that the user
     is continually asked whether he or she is done. 
     Continue looping while the user enters "no".
     Remember you can place console.log statements
     inside loops to "see" the values change. 

	```js
	var isDone = "no";
	while (isDone === null) {
		isDone = prompt("Are you done?");
	}
	```


1. Modify the solution to the above while loop
     below. Now, continue looping if "no" OR "No"
     is entered.

	```js
	var isDone = "no";
	while (isDone === null) {
		isDone = prompt("Are you done?");
	}
	```

1. Explain to each other in English what this statement does. It should be a simple statement.
     Look up functions such as Math.round() and Math.random() if they are new. Try pasting the
     individual parts of this statement into your console to better understand it!

	```js
	var theTarget = Math.round(100 * Math.random()) + 1;
	```


1. Number guessing game. While the guess is not
     the target value, continue asking the user
     for a guess and informing whether the guess
     is too low or too high. 

	```js
	var guess = 0;
	var theTarget = Math.round(100 * Math.random()) + 1;
	while (null) {
		guess = prompt("Make a guess!");

		if (null) {
			alert("Too high!");
		} else if (null) {
			alert("Too low!");
		}
	}
	```


1. The following while loop implements a 
      "count up" clock. Make it console.log the
      numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

	```js
	var i = null;
	while (i < null) {
		console.log(null);
		null;
	}
	```



## FOR LOOPS


1. Rewrite the "count up" clock as a for loop!

	```js
	for (null; null; null) {
		console.log(null);
	}
	```

1. Rewrite the for loop to have no initial conditions.

	```js
	null;
	for (; null; null) {
		console.log(null);
	}
	```

1. Rewrite the for loop to have no incrementing statement.

	```js
for (null; null; ) {
	console.log(null);
	null;
}
	```

1. Rewrite the for loop to have no incrementing or intial
     statements.
     
	```js
	null;
	for (; null; ) {
		console.log(null);
		null;
	}
	```

	/* Note that this is identical to the while loop! */


1. Let's make a count DOWN clock. We will display 
     5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

	```js
	var i = null;
	while (i >= null) {
		console.log(null);
		null;
	}
	```

1. Now, rewrite the countdown clock as a for loop!

	```js
	for (null; null; null) {
		console.log(null);
	}
	```


1. Using a for loop, print each value of the array
     to the console.

	```js
	var foods = ["Burger", "Fries", "Drink", "Tomato"];
	for (i=0; i<null; null) {
		console.log(null);
	}
	```

1. Using a for loop, print each value of the array
     to the console, backwards!
     
	```js
	var foods = ["Burger", "Fries", "Drink", "Tomato"];
	for (i=foods.length-1; null; null) {
		console.log(null);
	}
	```
