### Array Methods Challenge Problems

#### isPanagram

Using the following array - test whether each letter a-z (case insensitive) is used at least once

```js
const panagram = ['The', 'quick','brown','fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']
```


#### Working with data

- filter for products with a price that is less than 10, using the array below:
- sort alphabetically by product name

```js
const products = [
